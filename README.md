# Lab03-Word Guess Game
Code 401 started Jan 11, 2019

## Purpose:
This is a console run app to work on StreamWriter & System.IO.  Practice with writing, deleting txt file code and use xUnit testing methods for Code401 C# .NET class.

##Summary
So this is a console guess for guessing a hidden word.  The word is picked randomly from a list.

The user has the option to select admin to view the list words, add, or delete words into the list.

### How to run the program:
This program requires visual studio 2017.
Run the program to start the console application.
This will be under "Program.cs".

You may look at the source code to ensure nothing evil is in there.

* The console will welcome you to the amazing Word Guessing Game.
* The user may start the game or go into the Administration Menu.
* If selecting game, the user will be given an empty word with known number of letters.
* The user has unlimited number of trys to guess the word.
* The console will ask for only one letter at a time and NOT accept more than one letter into the guess.
* Letters are revealed if guessed correctly and the word eventually spells out.
* When the game is finished, the console will display a congratulations and reveal number of wrong guesses.

* If selecting Administration, the user will be given three choices.
* View the list of words.
* Add a word.
* Delete a word.

This assignment took about 12 hours to complete.  The hardest part was getting the xUNIT tests to run.


Below are screen shots of what this should look like.
